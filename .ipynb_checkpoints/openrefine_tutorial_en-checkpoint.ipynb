    "1. to keep track of the changes made to the original dataset\n",
    "2. because you can easily cancel an action\n",
    "3. because OpenRefine does not modify the original file, it creates a copy\n",

    "## Some notes on OpenRefine\n",
    "1. OpenRefine was originally designed by Google under the name **Google Refine** and then became an open-source project under the name OpenRefine.\n",
    "2. OpenRefine is a Java application and **a _sort_ of Java** has been developed especially for OpenRefine. This is a language called **GREL (General Refine Expression Language)**.\n",
    "3. OpenRefine has a new **online forum** focused on using OpenRefine:\n",
    "\n",
    "https://forum.openrefine.org/\n",
    "\n",
    "> **THE DOCUMENTATION HAS IMPROVED A LOT but it's still worth watching the online forums**\n",
    "\n",
    "4. OpenRefine is relatively efficient up to a limit of **1 million cells, 50 megabytes (MB)s or 50 columns per record**. You can improve this by allocating more memory https://docs.openrefine.org/manual/installing. A rule of thumb if you're running out of memory is to allocate 50% of however much memory you have left. That way you still have some wiggle room for all of your other computing needs. Do **NOT** allocate all of your available RAM or you'll run the risk of crashing your computer.\n",
    "5. As the project is _open source_, there are several modified versions of OpenRefine which allow in particular to use files of millions of lines or to do the operations in parallel.\n",
    "5. Today, we're using the internet but once you have OpenRefined installed, you don't need to be connected to the internet to use it."

    "1. You can install them in the program folder: They'll be erased with every new OpenRefine version. It is useful if you want to make sure that you have a version of the extension that matches the version of OpenRefine that you're using.\n",
    "2. You can install them in your workspace: They won't go away with the next upgrade. It is useful if you want to keep a specific version of your extension regardless of the version of OpenRefine that you are using."

    "If we ***keep the word*** in the search box, we can create a facet just for that word. If we remove the text search, we have the entire arrondissements column. The total count for each borough next to their name gives us a quick overview.\n",

    ">For example, if we type \"Parc\" in the filter box for NOM_QR, we find that neighboroods containing the word _Parc_ are found in Côte-des-neiges-Notre-Dame-de-grâce, Le Plateau-Mont-Royal, and Villeray-Saint-Michel-Parc-Extension\n",

    "\n",
    "We can also ***code*** that step, especially when it involves several similar modifications on a large number of cells. For example, it is common to remove accents from datasets when working with datasets in foreign languages. It allows data to be shared with people for whom the locale would not allow the interpretation of certain special characters.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "##### Exercise\n",

Select the columns you want to combine into one and pick either one column containing the values, or one column containing a key and one containing the values. Check \"Fill down in other columns\" to avoid getting empty cells.\n",

    "#### Reconcile\n",
    "\n",
    "Reconciliation is useful when we know of specific databases can be queried to enhance our dataset. Those databases have APIs specifically built to accept reconciliation with OpenRefine. You can choose a column that would contain unique identifiers that can be cross-referenced with the databases and choose:\n",
    "```reconcile / start reconciling```\n",

    "The process is semi-automated because in some cases OpenRefine will not be able to reconcile the cells with the database and it will have to be done by hand. Normally this is quite fast because wikidata allows about 3 requests per second. Once the data has been reconciled, we can fetch the additional data available through the database.\n",
    "\n",
    "```edit column / add columns from reconciled values```\n",
    "\n",
    "and do some tests. In our case, we only have \"Area\" and \"country\" to look for. But you could choose a different database to get different results. We must also consider that we do not have a particular set of data suitable for reconciliation.\n",
